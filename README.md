# MBTI Machine Learning

This code reads in Meyers-Briggs type data and builds a model to predict someone's MBTI type based on the text of their written posts.  The data set is available on Kaggle.  Search for "mbti".

Please note this is a work in progress.

## File Contents

1. **mbti_machine_learning.py**: Python code which reads the csv file and runs the algorithm
2. **TBD**: More Python source code files coming

All files shall be downloaded in the same directory.
